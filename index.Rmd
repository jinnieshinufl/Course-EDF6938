#### **Office**: 1602 Norman Hall \
#### **Office Hours**: By appointment 
<hr />

### 1. Course Description 
This course is designed to introduce the basic concepts and techniques of natural language processing in education research. We will especially focus on text mining and natural language understanding. Students will have opportunities **[1]** *to survey the NLP literature in emerging education research context* **[2]** *to acquire theoretical backgrounds to understand the methods and* **[3]** *to gain hands-on experience in education text analysis using Python.* The primary topics will include, but are not limited to, text vectorization, factor analysis and dimensionality reduction in text data, supervised and unsupervised analyses in text.

\

#### Objectives 

- Students will understand the growing **importance and demand of text analysis** in education assessment research 
- Students will gain basic **programming knowledge and hands-on experience** to conduct NLP analysis using Python  
- Students will acquire **theoretical and mathematical foundation** to understand the emerging NLP techniques in education research
