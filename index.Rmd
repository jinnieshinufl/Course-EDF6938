### 1. Course Description 
This project-based course is designed to introduce the basic concepts and techniques of natural language processing in education research. We will focus on text mining techniques and natural language understanding approaches commonly used in education text analysis. Students will have opportunities to survey the NLP literature in the emerging AI education research context to acquire theoretical backgrounds to understand the methods, and to gain hands-on experience in education text analysis using Python. The primary topics will include, but are not limited to, text vectorization, factor analysis and dimensionality reduction, supervised, unsupervised and deep learning in text analysis. Two primary learning components of this course include the theoretical and mathematical aspects of NLP and the hands-on programming experience in NLP analysis using Python. 
\

#### Objectives 

- Students will understand the growing **importance and demand of text analysis** in education assessment research 
- Students will gain basic **programming knowledge and hands-on experience** to conduct NLP analysis using Python  
- Students will acquire **theoretical and mathematical foundation** to understand the emerging NLP techniques in education research
